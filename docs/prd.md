## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a revolutionary no-code AI platform that transforms abstract business visions into market-ready applications
- Empower non-technical entrepreneurs with autonomous creation capabilities previously accessible only to technical experts
- Establish a comprehensive de-risking engine for the entire startup process
- Build a structured development platform using proven BMAD methodology
- Achieve product-market fit within 12 months with 1,000+ active users and $100K+ MRR

### Background Context
The current no-code landscape forces non-technical founders into a frustrating choice: either learn complex visual builders that require technical understanding, or remain dependent on expensive technical hires. Traditional platforms like Bubble and Webflow focus on simple app assembly rather than intelligent guidance through the complete development process.

Our platform addresses this gap by functioning as an intelligent thought partner that guides users through a structured 5-phase creation journey, ensuring high-fidelity translation of vision into validated, professional-grade applications. By implementing BMAD's proven development methodology with specialized AI agents, we create a platform that follows structured processes and delivers consistent, high-quality results.
