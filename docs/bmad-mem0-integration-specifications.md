## 2. BMAD Agent Enhancement Specifications

### 2.1 Agent Memory Integration

Each BMAD agent will be enhanced with Mem0 integration capabilities:

#### 2.1.1 Core Agent Enhancements

**Memory-Aware Agent Base Class:**
```typescript
interface MemoryAwareAgent extends BMADAgent {
  memoryContext: Mem0MemoryHierarchy;
  
  // Memory operations
  storeDecision(decision: AgentDecision, level: MemoryLevel): Promise<void>;
  retrieveContext(query: MemoryQuery): Promise<ContextData>;
  enrichContext(currentContext: string): Promise<string>;
  
  // Pattern recognition
  identifyPatterns(scope: PatternScope): Promise<Pattern[]>;
  suggestOptimizations(): Promise<Optimization[]>;
}
```

#### 2.1.2 Agent-Specific Memory Patterns

**PM Agent Memory Integration:**
- Store requirement gathering patterns
- Remember user communication preferences
- Track successful requirement elicitation methods
- Learn project complexity indicators

### 2.2 Enhanced Agent Handoff Protocol

#### 2.2.1 Memory-Enriched Handoffs

**Current BMAD Handoff:**
```
Agent A â†’ writes to file.md â†’ Agent B reads file.md
```

**Enhanced Mem0 Handoff:**
```
Agent A â†’ stores rich context in Mem0 â†’ Agent B accesses enriched context
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedHandoff {
  // Traditional file-based handoff
  documentPath: string;
  documentContent: string;
  
  // Mem0-enhanced context
  decisionRationale: DecisionContext[];
  alternativesConsidered: Alternative[];
  constraints: Constraint[];
  userPreferences: UserPreference[];
  relevantPatterns: Pattern[];
  
  // Memory references
  memoryReferences: MemoryReference[];
  contextLevel: MemoryLevel;
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Context Enrichment Process

1. **Pre-Handoff Context Storage:**
   - Agent stores decision rationale in appropriate memory level
   - Records alternatives considered and why they were rejected
   - Captures user feedback and preferences
   - Identifies relevant patterns from memory hierarchy

2. **Handoff Context Enrichment:**
   - Receiving agent queries relevant memory levels
   - Context automatically enriched with relevant historical data
   - User preferences and patterns applied
   - Potential issues flagged based on historical patterns

3. **Post-Handoff Learning:**
   - Success/failure patterns recorded
   - Agent collaboration effectiveness tracked
   - User satisfaction metrics captured
   - Memory hierarchy updated with new insights
