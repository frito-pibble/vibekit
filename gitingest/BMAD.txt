# BMad-Method: Universal AI Agent Framework

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bmad-method?color=blue&label=version)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bmad-method)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Node.js Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-%3E%3D20.0.0-brightgreen)](https://nodejs.org)

Foundations in Agentic Agile Driven Development, known as the Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development, yet so much more. Transform any domain with specialized AI expertise: software development, entertainment, creative writing, business strategy to personal wellness just to name a few.

**[Subscribe to BMadCode on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BMadCode?sub_confirmation=1)**

**[Join our Discord Community](https://discord.gg/gk8jAdXWmj)** - A growing community for AI enthusiasts! Get help, share ideas, explore AI agents & frameworks, collaborate on tech projects, enjoy hobbies, and help each other succeed. Whether you're stuck on BMad, building your own agents, or just want to chat about the latest in AI - we're here for you! **Some mobile and VPN may have issue joining the discord, this is a discord issue - if the invite does not work, try from your own internet or another network, or non-VPN.**

⭐ **If you find this project helpful or useful, please give it a star in the upper right hand corner!** It helps others discover BMad-Method and you will be notified of updates!

## Overview

**BMad Method's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. Through advanced prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop refinement, these planning agents produce comprehensive specifications that go far beyond generic AI task generation.

**2. Context-Engineered Development:** The Scrum Master agent then transforms these detailed plans into hyper-detailed development stories that contain everything the Dev agent needs - full context, implementation details, and architectural guidance embedded directly in story files.

This two-phase approach eliminates both **planning inconsistency** and **context loss** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

**📖 [See the complete workflow in the User Guide](bmad-core/user-guide.md)** - Planning phase, development cycle, and all agent roles

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the BMad Workflow

**Before diving in, review these critical workflow diagrams that explain how BMad works:**

1. **[Planning Workflow (Web UI)](bmad-core/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - How to create PRD and Architecture documents
2. **[Core Development Cycle (IDE)](bmad-core/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - How SM, Dev, and QA agents collaborate through story files

> ⚠️ **These diagrams explain 90% of BMad Method Agentic Agile flow confusion** - Understanding the PRD+Architecture creation and the SM/Dev/QA workflow and how agents pass notes through story files is essential - and also explains why this is NOT taskmaster or just a simple task runner!

## Important: Keep Your BMad Installation Updated

**Stay up-to-date effortlessly!** If you already have BMad-Method installed in your project, simply run:

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# OR
git pull
npm run install:bmad
```

This will:

- ✅ Automatically detect your existing v4 installation
- ✅ Update only the files that have changed and add new files
- ✅ Create `.bak` backup files for any custom modifications you've made
- ✅ Preserve your project-specific configurations

This makes it easy to benefit from the latest improvements, bug fixes, and new agents without losing your customizations!

## Quick Start

### One Command for Everything (IDE Installation)

**Just run one of these commands:**

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# OR if you already have BMad installed:
git pull
npm run install:bmad
```

This single command handles:

- **New installations** - Sets up BMad in your project
- **Upgrades** - Updates existing installations automatically
- **Expansion packs** - Installs any expansion packs you've added to package.json

> **That's it!** Whether you're installing for the first time, upgrading, or adding expansion packs - these commands do everything.

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ required

### Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal (2 minutes)

1. **Get the bundle**: Save or clone the [full stack team file](dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) or choose another team
2. **Create AI agent**: Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. **Upload & configure**: Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. **Start Ideating and Planning**: Start chatting! Type `*help` to see available commands or pick an agent like `*analyst` to start right in on creating a brief.
5. **CRITICAL**: Talk to BMad Orchestrator in the web at ANY TIME (#bmad-orchestrator command) and ask it questions about how this all works!
6. **When to move to the IDE**: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code! See the [User guide](bmad-core/user-guide.md) for more details

### Alternative: Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method.git
npm run install:bmad # build and install all to a destination folder
```

## 🌟 Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

BMad's natural language framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Also expansion packs can expand the core BMad-Method with specific functionality that is not generic for all cases. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) and learn to create your own!

# Contributing to this project

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! This document outlines the process for contributing and some guidelines to follow.

🆕 **New to GitHub or pull requests?** Check out our [beginner-friendly Pull Request Guide](docs/how-to-contribute-with-pull-requests.md) first!

📋 **Before contributing**, please read our [Guiding Principles](docs/GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md) to understand the BMad Method's core philosophy and architectural decisions.

Also note, we use the discussions feature in GitHub to have a community to discuss potential ideas, uses, additions and enhancements.

💬 **Discord Community**: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gk8jAdXWmj) for real-time discussions:

- **#general-dev** - Technical discussions, feature ideas, and development questions
- **#bugs-issues** - Bug reports and issue discussions

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please read it before participating.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating a new issue - it will guide you through providing:
   - Clear bug description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Model/IDE/BMad version details
   - Screenshots or links if applicable
3. **Consider discussing in Discord** (#bugs-issues channel) for quick help
4. **Indicate if you're working on a fix** to avoid duplicate efforts

### Suggesting Features

1. **Discuss first in Discord** (#general-dev channel) - the feature request template asks if you've done this
2. **Check existing issues and discussions** to avoid duplicates
3. **Use the feature request template** when creating an issue - it will guide you through:
   - Confirming Discord discussion
   - Describing the problem it solves
   - Explaining your solution
   - Listing alternatives considered
4. **Be specific** about why this feature would benefit the BMad community

### Pull Request Process

⚠️ **Before starting work:**

1. **For bugs**: Check if an issue exists (create one using the bug template if not)
2. **For features**: Ensure you've discussed in Discord (#general-dev) AND created a feature request issue
3. **For large changes**: Always open an issue first to discuss alignment

Please only propose small granular commits! If its large or significant, please discuss in the discussions tab and open up an issue first. I do not want you to waste your time on a potentially very large PR to have it rejected because it is not aligned or deviates from other planned changes. Communicate and lets work together to build and improve this great community project!

**Important**: All contributions must align with our [Guiding Principles](docs/GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md). Key points:

- Keep dev agents lean - they need context for coding, not documentation
- Web/planning agents can be larger with more complex tasks
- Everything is natural language (markdown) - no code in core framework
- Use expansion packs for domain-specific features

#### Which Branch for Your PR?

**Submit to `next` branch** (most contributions):

- ✨ New features or agents
- 🎨 Enhancements to existing features
- 📚 Documentation updates
- ♻️ Code refactoring
- ⚡ Performance improvements
- 🧪 New tests
- 🎁 New expansion packs

**Submit to `main` branch** (critical only):

- 🚨 Critical bug fixes that break basic functionality
- 🔒 Security patches
- 📚 Fixing dangerously incorrect documentation
- 🐛 Bugs preventing installation or basic usage

**When in doubt, submit to `next`**. We'd rather test changes thoroughly before they hit stable.

#### PR Size Guidelines

- **Ideal PR size**: 200-400 lines of code changes
- **Maximum PR size**: 800 lines (excluding generated files)
- **One feature/fix per PR**: Each PR should address a single issue or add one feature
- **If your change is larger**: Break it into multiple smaller PRs that can be reviewed independently
- **Related changes**: Even related changes should be separate PRs if they deliver independent value

#### Breaking Down Large PRs

If your change exceeds 800 lines, use this checklist to split it:

- [ ] Can I separate the refactoring from the feature implementation?
- [ ] Can I introduce the new API/interface in one PR and implementation in another?
- [ ] Can I split by file or module?
- [ ] Can I create a base PR with shared utilities first?
- [ ] Can I separate test additions from implementation?
- [ ] Even if changes are related, can they deliver value independently?
- [ ] Can these changes be merged in any order without breaking things?

Example breakdown:

1. PR #1: Add utility functions and types (100 lines)
2. PR #2: Refactor existing code to use utilities (200 lines)
3. PR #3: Implement new feature using refactored code (300 lines)
4. PR #4: Add comprehensive tests (200 lines)

**Note**: PRs #1 and #4 could be submitted simultaneously since they deliver independent value and don't depend on each other's merge order.

#### Pull Request Steps

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run any tests or linting to ensure quality
5. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages following our commit message convention
6. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`)
7. Open a Pull Request against the main branch

## Issue Templates

We use GitHub issue templates to ensure all necessary information is provided:

- **Bug Reports**: Automatically guides you through providing reproduction steps, environment details, and expected behavior
- **Feature Requests**: Requires Discord discussion confirmation and asks for problem/solution descriptions

Using these templates helps maintainers understand and address your contribution faster.

## Pull Request Description Guidelines

Keep PR descriptions short and to the point following this template:

### PR Description Template

Keep your PR description concise and focused. Use this template:

```markdown
## What

[1-2 sentences describing WHAT changed]

## Why

[1-2 sentences explaining WHY this change is needed]
Fixes #[issue number] (if applicable)

## How

[2-3 bullets listing HOW you implemented it]

-
-
-

## Testing

[1-2 sentences on how you tested this]
```

**Maximum PR description length: 200 words** (excluding code examples if needed)

### Good vs Bad PR Descriptions

❌ **Bad Example:**

> This revolutionary PR introduces a paradigm-shifting enhancement to the system's architecture by implementing a state-of-the-art solution that leverages cutting-edge methodologies to optimize performance metrics and deliver unprecedented value to stakeholders through innovative approaches...

✅ **Good Example:**

> **What:** Added validation for agent dependency resolution
> **Why:** Build was failing silently when agents had circular dependencies
> **How:**
>
> - Added cycle detection in dependency-resolver.js
> - Throws clear error with dependency chain
>   **Testing:** Tested with circular deps between 3 agents

## Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` Adding missing tests
- `chore:` Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Keep commit messages under 72 characters.

### Atomic Commits

Each commit should represent one logical change:

- **Do:** One bug fix per commit
- **Do:** One feature addition per commit
- **Don't:** Mix refactoring with bug fixes
- **Don't:** Combine unrelated changes

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write clear comments for complex logic

## License

# BMad-Method BMAd Code User Guide

This guide will help you understand and effectively use the BMad Method for agile ai driven planning and development.

## The BMad Plan and Execute Workflow

First, here is the full standard Greenfield Planning + Execution Workflow. Brownfield is very similar, but its suggested to understand this greenfield first, even if on a simple project before tackling a brownfield project. The BMad Method needs to be installed to the root of your new project folder. For the planning phase, you can optionally perform it with powerful web agents, potentially resulting in higher quality results at a fraction of the cost it would take to complete if providing your own API key or credits in some Agentic tools. For planning, powerful thinking models and larger context - along with working as a partner with the agents will net the best results.

If you are going to use the BMad Method with a Brownfield project (an existing project), review [Working in the Brownfield](./working-in-the-brownfield.md)

If you do not see the diagrams that following rendering, you can install Markdown All in One along with the Markdown Preview Mermaid Support plugins to VSCode (or one of the forked clones). With these plugin's, if you right click on the tab when open, there should be a Open Preview option, or check the IDE documentation.

### The Planning Workflow (Web UI or Powerful IDE Agents)

Before development begins, BMad follows a structured planning workflow that's ideally done in web UI for cost efficiency:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: Project Idea"] --> B{"Optional: Analyst Research"}
    B -->|Yes| C["Analyst: Brainstorming (Optional)"]

    style N fill:#1a73e8,color:#fff
    style O fill:#f9ab00,color:#fff
    style P fill:#34a853,color:#fff
```

#### Web UI to IDE Transition

**Critical Transition Point**: Once the PO confirms document alignment, you must switch from web UI to IDE to begin the development workflow:

1. **Copy Documents to Project**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` are in your project's docs folder (or a custom location you can specify during installation)
2. **Switch to IDE**: Open your project in your preferred Agentic IDE
3. **Document Sharding**: Use the PO agent to shard the PRD and then the Architecture
4. **Begin Development**: Start the Core Development Cycle that follows

### The Core Development Cycle (IDE)

Once planning is complete and documents are sharded, BMad follows a structured development workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Development Phase Start"] --> B["SM: Reviews Previous Story Dev/QA Notes"]
    B --> B2["SM: Drafts Next Story from Sharded Epic + Architecture"]
    B2 --> B3{"QA: Review Story Draft (Optional)"}
    B3 -->|Review Requested| B4["QA: Review Story Against Artifacts"]
    B3 -->|Skip Review| C{"User Approval"}
    B4 --> C
    C -->|Approved| D["Dev: Sequential Task Execution"]
    C -->|Needs Changes| B2
    D --> E["Dev: Implement Tasks + Tests"]
    E --> F["Dev: Run All Validations"]
    F --> G["Dev: Mark Ready for Review + Add Notes"]
    G --> H{"User Verification"}
    H -->|Request QA Review| I["QA: Senior Dev Review + Active Refactoring"]
    H -->|Approve Without QA| M["IMPORTANT: Verify All Regression Tests and Linting are Passing"]
    I --> J["QA: Review, Refactor Code, Add Tests, Document Notes"]
    J --> L{"QA Decision"}
    L -->|Needs Dev Work| D
    L -->|Approved| M
    H -->|Needs Fixes| D
    M --> N["IMPORTANT: COMMIT YOUR CHANGES BEFORE PROCEEDING!"]
    N --> K["Mark Story as Done"]
    K --> B

    style B fill:#e8f5e9,color:#000
    style B2 fill:#e8f5e9,color:#000
    style B3 fill:#e3f2fd,color:#000

    style L fill:#e3f2fd,color:#000
    style M fill:#ff5722,color:#fff
    style N fill:#d32f2f,color:#fff
```

## Installation

### Optional

If you want to do the planning in the Web with Claude (Sonnet 4 or Opus), Gemini Gem (2.5 Pro), or Custom GPT's:

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

### IDE Project Setup

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

## Special Agents

There are two bmad agents - in the future they will be consolidated into the single bmad-master.

### BMad-Master

This agent can do any task or command that all other agents can do, aside from actual story implementation. Additionally, this agent can help explain the BMad Method when in the web by accessing the knowledge base and explaining anything to you about the process.

If you dont want to bother switching between different agents aside from the dev, this is the agent for you.

### BMad-Orchestrator

This agent should NOT be used within the IDE, it is a heavy weight special purpose agent that utilizes a lot of context and can morph into any other agent. This exists solely to facilitate the team's within the web bundles. If you use a web bundle you will be greeted by the BMad Orchestrator.

### How Agents Work

#### Dependencies System

Each agent has a YAML section that defines its dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  templates:
    - prd-template.md
    - user-story-template.md
  tasks:
    - create-doc.md
    - shard-doc.md
  data:
    - bmad-kb.md
```

**Key Points:**

- Agents only load resources they need (lean context)
- Dependencies are automatically resolved during bundling
- Resources are shared across agents to maintain consistency

#### Agent Interaction

**In IDE:**

```bash
# Some Ide's, like Cursor or Windsurf for example, utilize manual rules so interaction is done with the '@' symbol
@pm Create a PRD for a task management app
@architect Design the system architecture
@dev Implement the user authentication

# Some, like Claude Code use slash commands instead
/pm Create user stories
/dev Fix the login bug
```

#### Interactive Modes

- **Incremental Mode**: Step-by-step with user input
- **YOLO Mode**: Rapid generation with minimal interaction

## IDE Integration

### IDE Best Practices

- **Context Management**: Keep relevant files only in context, keep files as lean and focused as necessary
- **Agent Selection**: Use appropriate agent for task
- **Iterative Development**: Work in small, focused tasks
- **File Organization**: Maintain clean project structure

## Technical Preferences System

BMad includes a personalization system through the `technical-preferences.md` file located in `.bmad-core/data/` - this can help bias the PM and Architect to recommend your preferences for design patterns, technology selection, or anything else you would like to put in here.

### Using with Web Bundles

When creating custom web bundles or uploading to AI platforms, include your `technical-preferences.md` content to ensure agents have your preferences from the start of any conversation.

## Core Configuration

The `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical config that enables BMad to work seamlessly with differing project structures, more options will be made available in the future. Currently the most important is the devLoadAlwaysFiles list section in the yaml.

### Developer Context Files

Define which files the dev agent should always load:

```yaml
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
  - docs/architecture/project-structure.md
```

You will want to verify from sharding your architecture that these documents exist, that they are as lean as possible, and contain exactly the information you want your dev agent to ALWAYS load into it's context. These are the rules the agent will follow.

As your project grows and the code starts to build consistent patterns, coding standards should be reduced to just the items that the agent makes mistakes at still - must with the better models, they will look at surrounding code in files and not need a rule from that file to guide them.

## Getting Help

- **Discord Community**: [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/gk8jAdXWmj)
- **GitHub Issues**: [Report bugs](https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method/issues)
- **Documentation**: [Browse docs](https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method/docs)
- **YouTube**: [BMadCode Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BMadCode)

## Conclusion

Remember: BMad is designed to enhance your development process, not replace your expertise. Use it as a powerful tool to accelerate your projects while maintaining control over design decisions and implementation details.

# Working in the Brownfield: A Complete Guide

> **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Use Gemini Web or Gemini CLI for Brownfield Documentation Generation!**
>
> Gemini Web's 1M+ token context window or Gemini CLI (when its working) can analyze your ENTIRE codebase or critical sections of it all at once (obviously within reason):
>
> - Upload via GitHub URL or use gemini cli in the project folder
> - If in the web: Upload up to 1000 files or the zipped project or just give it the github url

## What is Brownfield Development?

Brownfield development refers to adding features, fixing bugs, or modernizing existing software projects. Unlike greenfield (new) projects, brownfield work requires understanding existing code, respecting constraints, and ensuring new changes integrate seamlessly without breaking existing functionality.

## When to Use BMad for Brownfield

- Add significant new features to existing applications
- Modernize legacy codebases
- Integrate new technologies or services
- Refactor complex systems
- Fix bugs that require architectural understanding
- Document undocumented systems

## When NOT to use a Brownfield Flow

If you have just completed an MVP with BMad, and you want to continue with post-MVP, its easier to just talk to the PM and ask him to work with you to create a new epic to add into the PRD, shard out the epic, update any architecture documents with the architect, and just go from there.

## The Complete Brownfield Workflow

### Choose Your Approach

#### Approach A: PRD-First (Recommended if adding very large and complex new features, single or multiple epics or massive changes)

**Best for**: Large codebases, monorepos, or when you know exactly what you want to build

1. **Create PRD First** to define requirements
2. **Document only relevant areas** based on PRD needs
3. **More efficient** - avoids documenting unused code

#### Approach B: Document-First (Good for Smaller Projects)

**Best for**: Smaller codebases, unknown systems, or exploratory changes

1. **Document entire system** first
2. **Create PRD** with full context
3. **More thorough** - captures everything

### Approach A: PRD-First Workflow (Recommended)

#### Phase 1: Define Requirements First

**In Gemini Web (with your codebase uploaded):**

```bash
@pm
*create-doc brownfield-prd
```

The PM will:

- **Ask about your enhancement** requirements
- **Explore the codebase** to understand current state
- **Identify affected areas** that need documentation
- **Create focused PRD** with clear scope

**Key Advantage**: The PRD identifies which parts of your monorepo/large codebase actually need documentation!

#### Phase 2: Focused Documentation

**Still in Gemini Web, now with PRD context:**

```bash
@analyst
*document-project
```

The analyst will:

- **Ask about your focus** if no PRD was provided
- **Offer options**: Create PRD, provide requirements, or describe the enhancement
- **Reference the PRD/description** to understand scope
- **Focus on relevant modules** identified in PRD or your description
- **Skip unrelated areas** to keep docs lean
- **Generate ONE architecture document** for all environments

The analyst creates:

- **One comprehensive architecture document** following fullstack-architecture template
- **Covers all system aspects** in a single file
- **Easy to copy and save** as `docs/project-architecture.md`
- **Can be sharded later** in IDE if desired

For example, if you say "Add payment processing to user service":

- Documents only: user service, API endpoints, database schemas, payment integrations
- Creates focused source tree showing only payment-related code paths
- Skips: admin panels, reporting modules, unrelated microservices

### Approach B: Document-First Workflow

#### Phase 1: Document the Existing System

**Best Approach - Gemini Web with 1M+ Context**:

1. **Go to Gemini Web** (gemini.google.com)
2. **Upload your project**:
   - **Option A**: Paste your GitHub repository URL directly
   - **Option B**: Upload up to 1000 files from your src/project folder
   - **Option C**: Zip your project and upload the archive
3. **Load the analyst agent**: Upload `dist/agents/analyst.txt`
4. **Run documentation**: Type `*document-project`

The analyst will generate comprehensive documentation of everything.

#### Phase 2: Plan Your Enhancement

#### Option A: Full Brownfield Workflow (Recommended for Major Changes)

**1. Create Brownfield PRD**:

```bash
@pm
*create-doc brownfield-prd
```

The PM agent will:

- **Analyze existing documentation** from Phase 1
- **Request specific enhancement details** from you
- **Assess complexity** and recommend approach
- **Create epic/story structure** for the enhancement
- **Identify risks and integration points**

**How PM Agent Gets Project Context**:

- In Gemini Web: Already has full project context from Phase 1 documentation
- In IDE: Will ask "Please provide the path to your existing project documentation"

**Key Prompts You'll Encounter**:

- "What specific enhancement or feature do you want to add?"
- "Are there any existing systems or APIs this needs to integrate with?"
- "What are the critical constraints we must respect?"
- "What is your timeline and team size?"

**2. Create Brownfield Architecture**:

```bash
@architect
*create-doc brownfield-architecture
```

The architect will:

- **Review the brownfield PRD**
- **Design integration strategy**
- **Plan migration approach** if needed
- **Identify technical risks**
- **Define compatibility requirements**

#### Option B: Quick Enhancement (For Focused Changes)

**For Single Epic Without Full PRD**:

```bash
@pm
*brownfield-create-epic
```

Use when:

- Enhancement is well-defined and isolated
- Existing documentation is comprehensive
- Changes don't impact multiple systems
- You need quick turnaround

**For Single Story**:

```bash
@pm
*brownfield-create-story
```

Use when:

- Bug fix or tiny feature
- Very isolated change
- No architectural impact
- Clear implementation path

### Phase 3: Validate Planning Artifacts

```bash
@po
*execute-checklist po-master-checklist
```

The PO ensures:

- Compatibility with existing system
- No breaking changes planned
- Risk mitigation strategies in place
- Clear integration approach

### Phase 4: Transition to Development

Follow the enhanced IDE Development Workflow:

1. **Ensure documents are in project**:

   - Copy `docs/prd.md` (or brownfield-prd.md)
   - Copy `docs/architecture.md` (or brownfield-architecture.md)

2. **Shard documents**:

   ```bash
   @po
   # Ask to shard docs/prd.md
   ```

3. **Development cycle**:
   - **SM** creates stories with integration awareness
   - **Dev** implements with existing code respect
   - **QA** reviews for compatibility and improvements

## Brownfield Best Practices

### 1. Always Document First

Even if you think you know the codebase:

- Run `document-project` to capture current state
- AI agents need this context
- Discovers undocumented patterns

### 2. Respect Existing Patterns

The brownfield templates specifically look for:

- Current coding conventions
- Existing architectural patterns
- Technology constraints
- Team preferences

### 3. Plan for Gradual Rollout

Brownfield changes should:

- Support feature flags
- Plan rollback strategies
- Include migration scripts
- Maintain backwards compatibility

### 4. Test Integration Thoroughly

Focus testing on:

- Integration points
- Existing functionality (regression)
- Performance impact
- Data migrations

### 5. Communicate Changes

Document:

- What changed and why
- Migration instructions
- New patterns introduced
- Deprecation notices

## Common Brownfield Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Feature

1. Document existing system
2. Create brownfield PRD focusing on integration
3. Architecture emphasizes compatibility
4. Stories include integration tasks

### Scenario 2: Modernizing Legacy Code

1. Extensive documentation phase
2. PRD includes migration strategy
3. Architecture plans gradual transition
4. Stories follow strangler fig pattern

### Scenario 3: Bug Fix in Complex System

1. Document relevant subsystems
2. Use `brownfield-create-story` for focused fix
3. Include regression test requirements
4. QA validates no side effects

### Scenario 4: API Integration

1. Document existing API patterns
2. PRD defines integration requirements
3. Architecture ensures consistent patterns
4. Stories include API documentation updates

## Troubleshooting

### "The AI doesn't understand my codebase"

**Solution**: Re-run `document-project` with more specific paths to critical files

### "Generated plans don't fit our patterns"

**Solution**: Update generated documentation with your specific conventions before planning phase

### "Too much boilerplate for small changes"

**Solution**: Use `brownfield-create-story` instead of full workflow

### "Integration points unclear"

**Solution**: Provide more context during PRD creation, specifically highlighting integration systems

## Quick Reference

### Brownfield-Specific Commands

```bash
# Document existing project
@analyst → *document-project

# Create enhancement PRD
@pm → *create-doc brownfield-prd

# Create architecture with integration focus
@architect → *create-doc brownfield-architecture

# Quick epic creation
@pm → *brownfield-create-epic

# Single story creation
@pm → *brownfield-create-story
```

### Decision Tree

```text
Do you have a large codebase or monorepo?
├─ Yes → PRD-First Approach
│   └─ Create PRD → Document only affected areas
└─ No → Is the codebase well-known to you?
    ├─ Yes → PRD-First Approach
    └─ No → Document-First Approach

Is this a major enhancement affecting multiple systems?
├─ Yes → Full Brownfield Workflow
└─ No → Is this more than a simple bug fix?
    ├─ Yes → brownfield-create-epic
    └─ No → brownfield-create-story
```

## Conclusion

Brownfield development with BMad-Method provides structure and safety when modifying existing systems. The key is providing comprehensive context through documentation, using specialized templates that consider integration requirements, and following workflows that respect existing constraints while enabling progress.

Remember: **Document First, Plan Carefully, Integrate Safely**

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md → {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Greet user with your name/role and mention `*help` command
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

  💡 Tip: Each agent has unique tasks, templates, and checklists. Switch to an agent to access their capabilities!

fuzzy-matching:
  - 85% confidence threshold
  - Show numbered list if unsure
transformation:
  - Match name/role to agents
  - Announce transformation
  - Operate until exit
loading:
  - KB: Only for *kb-mode or BMad questions
  - Agents: Only when transforming
  - Templates/Tasks: Only when executing
  - Always indicate loading
kb-mode-behavior:
  - When *kb-mode is invoked, use kb-mode-interaction task
  - Don't dump all KB content immediately
  - Present topic areas and wait for user selection
  - Provide focused, contextual responses
workflow-guidance:
  - Discover available workflows in the bundle at runtime
  - Understand each workflow's purpose, options, and decision points
  - Ask clarifying questions based on the workflow's structure
  - Guide users through workflow selection when multiple options exist
  - When appropriate, suggest: "Would you like me to create a detailed workflow plan before starting?"
  - For workflows with divergent paths, help users choose the right path
  - Adapt questions to the specific domain (e.g., game dev vs infrastructure vs web dev)
  - Only recommend workflows that actually exist in the current bundle
  - When *workflow-guidance is called, start an interactive session and list all available workflows with brief descriptions

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md → {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Greet user with your name/role and mention `*help` command
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before development execution. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the architecture is robust, scalable, secure, and aligned with the product requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document for requirements alignment (check docs/prd.md)
3. frontend-architecture.md or fe-architecture.md - If this is a UI project (check docs/frontend-architecture.md)
4. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
5. API documentation if available
6. Technology stack details and version specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Does the architecture include a frontend/UI component?
- Is there a frontend-architecture.md document?
- Does the PRD mention user interfaces or frontend requirements?

If this is a backend-only or service-only project:

- Skip sections marked with [[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Focus extra attention on API design, service architecture, and integration patterns
- Note in your final report that frontend sections were skipped due to project type

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. REQUIREMENTS ALIGNMENT

[[LLM: Before evaluating this section, take a moment to fully understand the product's purpose and goals from the PRD. What is the core problem being solved? Who are the users? What are the critical success factors? Keep these in mind as you validate alignment. For each item, don't just check if it's mentioned - verify that the architecture provides a concrete technical solution.]]

### 1.1 Functional Requirements Coverage

- [ ] Architecture supports all functional requirements in the PRD
- [ ] Technical approaches for all epics and stories are addressed
- [ ] Edge cases and performance scenarios are considered
- [ ] All required integrations are accounted for
- [ ] User journeys are supported by the technical architecture

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements Alignment

- [ ] Performance requirements are addressed with specific solutions

- [ ] All technical constraints from PRD are satisfied
- [ ] Platform/language requirements are followed
- [ ] Infrastructure constraints are accommodated
- [ ] Third-party service constraints are addressed
- [ ] Organizational technical standards are followed

## 2. ARCHITECTURE FUNDAMENTALS

[[LLM: Architecture clarity is crucial for successful implementation. As you review this section, visualize the system as if you were explaining it to a new developer. Are there any ambiguities that could lead to misinterpretation? Would an AI agent be able to implement this architecture without confusion? Look for specific diagrams, component definitions, and clear interaction patterns.]]

### 2.1 Architecture Clarity

- [ ] Architecture is documented with clear diagrams
- [ ] Major components and their responsibilities are defined

## 3. TECHNICAL STACK & DECISIONS

[[LLM: Technology choices have long-term implications. For each technology decision, consider: Is this the simplest solution that could work? Are we over-engineering? Will this scale? What are the maintenance implications? Are there security vulnerabilities in the chosen versions? Verify that specific versions are defined, not ranges.]]

### 3.1 Technology Selection

- [ ] Selected technologies meet all requirements

================================================
# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the BMad workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - CHANGE NAVIGATION

Changes during development are inevitable, but how we handle them determines project success or failure.

Before proceeding, understand:

1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes that affect the project direction
2. Minor adjustments within a story don't require this process
3. The goal is to minimize wasted work while adapting to new realities
4. User buy-in is critical - they must understand and approve changes

Required context:

- The triggering story or issue
- Current project state (completed stories, current epic)
- Access to PRD, architecture, and other key documents
- Understanding of remaining work planned

APPROACH:
This is an interactive process with the user. Work through each section together, discussing implications and options. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert guidance on technical feasibility and impact.

REMEMBER: Changes are opportunities to improve, not failures. Handle them professionally and constructively.]]

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by fully understanding what went wrong and why. Don't jump to solutions yet. Ask probing questions:

- What exactly happened that triggered this review?
- Is this a one-time issue or symptomatic of a larger problem?
- Could this have been anticipated earlier?
- What assumptions were incorrect?

Be specific and factual, not blame-oriented.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

[[LLM: Changes ripple through the project structure. Systematically evaluate:

1. Can we salvage the current epic with modifications?
2. Do future epics still make sense given this change?
3. Are we creating or eliminating dependencies?
4. Does the epic sequence need reordering?

Think about both immediate and downstream effects.]]

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: Documentation drives development in BMad. Check each artifact:

1. Does this change invalidate documented decisions?
2. Are architectural assumptions still valid?
3. Do user flows need rethinking?
4. Are technical constraints different than documented?

Be thorough - missed conflicts cause future problems.]]

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present options clearly with pros/cons. For each path:

1. What's the effort required?
2. What work gets thrown away?
3. What risks are we taking?
4. How does this affect timeline?
5. Is this sustainable long-term?

Be honest about trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution.]]

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

[[LLM: The proposal must be actionable and clear. Ensure:

1. The issue is explained in plain language
2. Impacts are quantified where possible
3. The recommended path has clear rationale
4. Next steps are specific and assigned
5. Success criteria for the change are defined

This proposal guides all subsequent work.]]

(Ensure all agreed-upon points from previous sections are captured in the proposal)

- [ ] **Identified Issue Summary:** Clear, concise problem statement.
- [ ] **Epic Impact Summary:** How epics are affected.
- [ ] **Artifact Adjustment Needs:** List of documents to change.
- [ ] **Recommended Path Forward:** Chosen solution with rationale.
- [ ] **PRD MVP Impact:** Changes to scope/goals (if any).
- [ ] **High-Level Action Plan:** Next steps for stories/updates.
- [ ] **Agent Handoff Plan:** Identify roles needed (PM, Arch, Design Arch, PO).

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

[[LLM: Changes require coordination. Before concluding:

1. Is the user fully aligned with the plan?
2. Do all stakeholders understand the impacts?
3. Are handoffs to other agents clear?
4. Is there a rollback plan if the change fails?
5. How will we validate the change worked?

Get explicit approval - implicit agreement causes problems.

FINAL REPORT:
After completing the checklist, provide a concise summary:

- What changed and why
- What we're doing about it
- Who needs to do what
- When we'll know if it worked

Keep it action-oriented and forward-looking.]]

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents.

# Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PO MASTER CHECKLIST

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

1. Is this a GREENFIELD project (new from scratch)?

   - Look for: New project initialization, no existing codebase references
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, new project setup stories

2. Is this a BROWNFIELD project (enhancing existing system)?

   - Look for: References to existing codebase, enhancement/modification language
   - Check for: brownfield-prd.md, brownfield-architecture.md, existing system analysis

3. Does the project include UI/UX components?
   - Check for: frontend-architecture.md, UI/UX specifications, design files
   - Look for: Frontend stories, component specifications, user interface mentions

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For GREENFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The Product Requirements Document
- architecture.md - The system architecture
- frontend-architecture.md - If UI/UX is involved
- All epic and story definitions

For BROWNFIELD projects:

- brownfield-prd.md - The brownfield enhancement requirements
- brownfield-architecture.md - The enhancement architecture
- Existing project codebase access (CRITICAL - cannot proceed without this)
- Current deployment configuration and infrastructure details
- Database schemas, API documentation, monitoring setup

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:

- Skip sections marked [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] for greenfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[GREENFIELD ONLY]] for brownfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[UI/UX ONLY]] for backend-only projects
- Note all skipped sections in your final report

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. Deep Analysis - Thoroughly analyze each item against documentation

# Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]

================================================
# Story Draft Checklist

The Scrum Master should use this checklist to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DRAFT VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. The story document being validated (usually in docs/stories/ or provided directly)
2. The parent epic context
3. Any referenced architecture or design documents
4. Previous related stories if this builds on prior work

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates individual stories BEFORE implementation begins.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Clarity - A developer should understand WHAT to build
2. Context - WHY this is being built and how it fits
3. Guidance - Key technical decisions and patterns to follow
4. Testability - How to verify the implementation works
5. Self-Contained - Most info needed is in the story itself

REMEMBER: We assume competent developer agents who can:

- Research documentation and codebases
- Make reasonable technical decisions
- Follow established patterns
- Ask for clarification when truly stuck

We're checking for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail.]]

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

[[LLM: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify:

1. The story states WHAT functionality to implement
2. The business value or user benefit is clear
3. How this fits into the larger epic/product is explained
4. Dependencies are explicit ("requires Story X to be complete")
5. Success looks like something specific, not vague]]

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check:

1. Key files/components to create or modify are mentioned
2. Technology choices are specified where non-obvious
3. Integration points with existing code are identified
4. Data models or API contracts are defined or referenced
5. Non-standard patterns or exceptions are called out

Note: We don't need every file listed - just the important ones.]]

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

[[LLM: References should help, not create a treasure hunt. Ensure:

1. References point to specific sections, not whole documents
2. The relevance of each reference is explained
3. Critical information is summarized in the story
4. References are accessible (not broken links)
5. Previous story context is summarized if needed]]

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

[[LLM: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify:

1. Core requirements are in the story, not just in references
2. Domain terms are explained or obvious from context
3. Assumptions are stated explicitly
4. Edge cases are mentioned (even if deferred)
5. The story could be understood without reading 10 other documents]]

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Testing ensures the implementation actually works. Check:

1. Test approach is specified (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Key test scenarios are listed
3. Success criteria are measurable
4. Special test considerations are noted
5. Acceptance criteria in the story are testable]]

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

Generate a concise validation report:

1. Quick Summary

   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:

   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)

   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work down and not create a mess.]]

# BMad Knowledge Base

## Overview

BMad-Method (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

### When to Use BMad

- **New Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end development
- **Existing Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple roles working together
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Professional PRDs, architecture docs, user stories

## How BMad Works

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.)
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective

### The Two-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows (Gemini's 1M tokens)
- Generate comprehensive documents (PRD, Architecture)
- Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
- Create once, use throughout development

#### Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM → Dev cycles
- One story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time file operations and testing

### The Development Loop

```text
1. SM Agent (New Chat) → Creates next story from sharded docs
2. You → Review and approve story
3. Dev Agent (New Chat) → Implements approved story
4. QA Agent (New Chat) → Reviews and refactors code
5. You → Verify completion
6. Repeat until epic complete
```

### Why This Works

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
- **Incremental Progress**: Small stories = manageable complexity
- **Human Oversight**: You validate each step = quality control
- **Document-Driven**: Specs guide everything = consistency

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI

**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:

- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Note for VS Code Users**: BMad-Method assumes when you mention "VS Code" that you're using it with an AI-powered extension like GitHub Copilot, Cline, or Roo. Standard VS Code without AI capabilities cannot run BMad agents. The installer includes built-in support for Cline and Roo.

**Verify Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- All agent commands/rules/modes available

**Remember**: At its core, BMad-Method is about mastering and harnessing prompt engineering. Any IDE with AI agent support can use BMad - the framework provides the structured prompts and workflows that make AI development effective

### Environment Selection Guide

**Use Web UI for**:

- Initial planning and documentation (PRD, architecture)
- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:

- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only**:

- Single environment workflow
- Direct file operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only**:

- Higher token costs for large document creation
- Smaller context windows (varies by IDE/model)
- May hit limits during planning phases
- Less cost-effective for brainstorming

**Using Web Agents in IDE**:

- **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Web agents (PM, Architect) have rich dependencies designed for large contexts
- **Why it matters**: Dev agents are kept lean to maximize coding context
- **The principle**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan" - mixing breaks this optimization

**About bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator**:

- **bmad-master**: CAN do any task without switching agents, BUT...
- **Still use specialized agents for planning**: PM, Architect, and UX Expert have tuned personas that produce better results
- **Why specialization matters**: Each agent's personality and focus creates higher quality outputs
- **If using bmad-master/orchestrator**: Fine for planning phases, but...

**CRITICAL RULE for Development**:

- **ALWAYS use SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Dev agent for implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: SM and Dev agents are specifically optimized for the development workflow
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for everything else, switch to SM → Dev for implementation

**Best Practice for IDE-Only**:

1. Use PM/Architect/UX agents for planning (better than bmad-master)
2. Create documents directly in project
3. Shard immediately after creation
4. **MUST switch to SM agent** for story creation
5. **MUST switch to Dev agent** for implementation
6. Keep planning and coding in separate chat sessions

## Core Configuration (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMad to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yaml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMad agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration

- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration

- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files

- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMad to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft → Approved → InProgress → Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

### Agent Interaction Commands

#### IDE-Specific Syntax

**Agent Loading by IDE**:

- **Claude Code**: `/agent-name` (e.g., `/bmad-master`)
- **Cursor**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Windsurf**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Trae**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Roo Code**: Select mode from mode selector (e.g., `bmad-master`)
- **GitHub Copilot**: Open the Chat view (`⌃⌘I` on Mac, `Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux) and select **Agent** from the chat mode selector.

**Chat Management Guidelines**:

- **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae**: Start new chats when switching agents
- **Roo Code**: Switch modes within the same conversation

**Common Task Commands**:

- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*status` - Show current context/progress
- `*exit` - Exit the agent mode
- `*shard-doc docs/prd.md prd` - Shard PRD into manageable pieces
- `*shard-doc docs/architecture.md architecture` - Shard architecture document
- `*create` - Run create-next-story task (SM agent)

**In Web UI**:

```text
/pm create-doc prd
/architect review system design
/dev implement story 1.2
/help - Show available commands
/switch agent-name - Change active agent (if orchestrator available)
```

## Team Configurations

## Core Architecture

### System Overview

The BMad-Method is built around a modular architecture centered on the `bmad-core` directory, which serves as the brain of the entire system. This design enables the framework to operate effectively in both IDE environments (like Cursor, VS Code) and web-based AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini).

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Agents (`bmad-core/agents/`)

- **Purpose**: Each markdown file defines a specialized AI agent for a specific Agile role (PM, Dev, Architect, etc.)
- **Structure**: Contains YAML headers specifying the agent's persona, capabilities, and dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Lists of tasks, templates, checklists, and data files the agent can use
- **Startup Instructions**: Can load project-specific documentation for immediate context

#### 2. Agent Teams (`bmad-core/agent-teams/`)

- **Purpose**: Define collections of agents bundled together for specific purposes
- **Examples**: `team-all.yaml` (comprehensive bundle), `team-fullstack.yaml` (full-stack development)
- **Usage**: Creates pre-packaged contexts for web UI environments

#### 3. Workflows (`bmad-core/workflows/`)

- **Purpose**: YAML files defining prescribed sequences of steps for specific project types
- **Types**: Greenfield (new projects) and Brownfield (existing projects) for UI, service, and fullstack development
- **Structure**: Defines agent interactions, artifacts created, and transition conditions

#### 4. Reusable Resources

- **Templates** (`bmad-core/templates/`): Markdown templates for PRDs, architecture specs, user stories
- **Tasks** (`bmad-core/tasks/`): Instructions for specific repeatable actions like "shard-doc" or "create-next-story"
- **Checklists** (`bmad-core/checklists/`): Quality assurance checklists for validation and review
- **Data** (`bmad-core/data/`): Core knowledge base and technical preferences

### Dual Environment Architecture

#### IDE Environment

- Users interact directly with agent markdown files
- Agents can access all dependencies dynamically
- Supports real-time file operations and project integration
- Optimized for development workflow execution

#### Web UI Environment

- Uses pre-built bundles from `dist/teams` for stand alone 1 upload files for all agents and their assets with an orchestrating agent
- Single text files containing all agent dependencies are in `dist/agents/` - these are unnecessary unless you want to create a web agent that is only a single agent and not a team
- Created by the web-builder tool for upload to web interfaces
- Provides complete context in one package

### Template Processing System

BMad employs a sophisticated template system with three key components:

1. **Template Format** (`utils/bmad-doc-template.md`): Defines markup language for variable substitution and AI processing directives from yaml templates
2. **Document Creation** (`tasks/create-doc.md`): Orchestrates template selection and user interaction to transform yaml spec to final markdown output
3. **Advanced Elicitation** (`tasks/advanced-elicitation.md`): Provides interactive refinement through structured brainstorming

### Technical Preferences Integration

The `technical-preferences.md` file serves as a persistent technical profile that:

- Ensures consistency across all agents and projects
- Eliminates repetitive technology specification
- Provides personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Evolves over time with lessons learned

### Build and Delivery Process

The `web-builder.js` tool creates web-ready bundles by:

1. Reading agent or team definition files
2. Recursively resolving all dependencies
3. Concatenating content into single text files with clear separators
4. Outputting ready-to-upload bundles for web AI interfaces

This architecture enables seamless operation across environments while maintaining the rich, interconnected agent ecosystem that makes BMad powerful.

## Complete Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context:**

**For Brownfield Projects - Start Here!**:

1. **Upload entire project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Document existing system**: `/analyst` → `*document-project`
3. **Creates comprehensive docs** from entire codebase analysis

**For All Projects**:

1. **Optional Analysis**: `/analyst` - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **Project Brief**: Create foundation document (Analyst or user)
3. **PRD Creation**: `/pm create-doc prd` - Comprehensive product requirements
4. **Architecture Design**: `/architect create-doc architecture` - Technical foundation
5. **Validation & Alignment**: `/po` run master checklist to ensure document consistency
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to project as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example Planning Prompts

**For PRD Creation**:

```text
"I want to build a [type] application that [core purpose].
Help me brainstorm features and create a comprehensive PRD."
```

**For Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this PRD, design a scalable technical architecture
that can handle [specific requirements]."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to IDE

**Once planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for development:**

- **Why**: Development workflow requires file operations, real-time project integration, and document sharding
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large document creation; IDE is optimized for development tasks
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` exist in your project

### IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP):
   - Documents created by PM/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Two methods to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Drag `shard-doc` task + document file into chat
     b) **Agent**: Ask `@bmad-master` or `@po` to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/prd.md` → `docs/prd/` folder
   - Shards `docs/architecture.md` → `docs/architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Content**:
   - At least one `epic-n.md` file in `docs/prd/` with stories in development order
   - Source tree document and coding standards for dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for SM agent story creation

Resulting Folder Structure:

- `docs/prd/` - Broken down PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` - Broken down architecture sections
- `docs/stories/` - Generated user stories

1. **Development Cycle** (Sequential, one story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between SM, Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Story Creation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Select powerful model → `@sm` → `*create`
   - SM executes create-next-story task
   - Review generated story in `docs/stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Story Implementation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `@dev`
   - Agent asks which story to implement
   - Include story file content to save dev agent lookup time
   - Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Dev maintains File List of all changes
   - Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all tests passing

   **Step 3 - Senior QA Review**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `@qa` → execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status → "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue SM → Dev → QA cycle until all epic stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all epic stories complete.

### Status Tracking Workflow

Stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** → **Approved** → **InProgress** → **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Development

- Business analysis and market research
- Product requirements and feature definition  
- System architecture and design
- Development execution
- Testing and deployment

#### Brownfield Enhancement (Existing Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing project for AI agents to understand context, patterns, and constraints.

**Complete Brownfield Workflow Options**:

**Option 1: PRD-First (Recommended for Large Codebases/Monorepos)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create PRD first**: `@pm` → `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
3. **Focused documentation**: `@analyst` → `*document-project`
   - Analyst asks for focus if no PRD provided
   - Choose "single document" format for Web UI
   - Uses PRD to document ONLY relevant areas
   - Creates one comprehensive markdown file
   - Avoids bloating docs with unused code

**Option 2: Document-First (Good for Smaller Projects)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web**
2. **Document everything**: `@analyst` → `*document-project`
3. **Then create PRD**: `@pm` → `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
   - More thorough but can create excessive documentation

4. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - **Brownfield PRD**: Use PM agent with `brownfield-prd-tmpl`
   - **Analyzes**: Existing system, constraints, integration points
   - **Defines**: Enhancement scope, compatibility requirements, risk assessment
   - **Creates**: Epic and story structure for changes

5. **Architecture Planning**:
   - **Brownfield Architecture**: Use Architect agent with `brownfield-architecture-tmpl`
   - **Integration Strategy**: How new features integrate with existing system
   - **Migration Planning**: Gradual rollout and backwards compatibility
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Addressing potential breaking changes

**Brownfield-Specific Resources**:

**Templates**:

- `brownfield-prd-tmpl.md`: Comprehensive enhancement planning with existing system analysis
- `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.md`: Integration-focused architecture for existing systems

**Tasks**:

- `document-project`: Generates comprehensive documentation from existing codebase
- `brownfield-create-epic`: Creates single epic for focused enhancements (when full PRD is overkill)
- `brownfield-create-story`: Creates individual story for small, isolated changes

**When to Use Each Approach**:

**Full Brownfield Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major feature additions
- System modernization
- Complex integrations
- Multiple related changes

**Quick Epic/Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused enhancement
- Isolated bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing system

**Critical Success Factors**:

1. **Documentation First**: Always run `document-project` if docs are outdated/missing
2. **Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant code sections
3. **Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and testing

**For detailed guide**: See `docs/working-in-the-brownfield.md`

## Document Creation Best Practices

### Required File Naming for Framework Integration

- `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/architecture.md` - System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter**:

- Agents automatically reference these files during development
- Sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Documents (PRD, Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Switch to IDE**: Use IDE agents for development and smaller documents

### Document Sharding

Templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original PRD**:

```markdown
## Goals and Background Context
## Requirements  
## User Interface Design Goals
## Success Metrics
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md`
- `docs/prd/requirements.md`
- `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md`
- `docs/prd/success-metrics.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic sharding.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Environment-Specific Usage

**Web UI Best For**:

- Initial planning and documentation phases
- Cost-effective large document creation
- Agent consultation and brainstorming
- Multi-agent workflows with orchestrator

**IDE Best For**:

# Advanced Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives
- Usable during template-driven document creation or any chat conversation

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Template Document Creation

After outputting a section during document creation:

1. **Section Review**: Ask user to review the drafted section
2. **Offer Elicitation**: Present 9 carefully selected elicitation methods
3. **Simple Selection**: User types a number (0-8) to engage method, or 9 to proceed
4. **Execute & Loop**: Apply selected method, then re-offer choices until user proceeds

### Scenario 2: General Chat Elicitation

User can request advanced elicitation on any agent output:

- User says "do advanced elicitation" or similar
- Agent selects 9 relevant methods for the context
- Same simple 0-9 selection process

## Task Instructions

### 1. Intelligent Method Selection

**Context Analysis**: Before presenting options, analyze:

- **Content Type**: Technical specs, user stories, architecture, requirements, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, moderate, or complex content
- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who will use this information
- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions vs routine items
- **Creative Potential**: Opportunities for innovation or alternatives

**Method Selection Strategy**:

1. **Always Include Core Methods** (choose 3-4):
   - Expand or Contract for Audience
   - Critique and Refine
   - Identify Potential Risks
   - Assess Alignment with Goals

2. **Context-Specific Methods** (choose 4-5):
   - **Technical Content**: Tree of Thoughts, ReWOO, Meta-Prompting
   - **User-Facing Content**: Agile Team Perspective, Stakeholder Roundtable
   - **Creative Content**: Innovation Tournament, Escape Room Challenge
   - **Strategic Content**: Red Team vs Blue Team, Hindsight Reflection

3. **Always Include**: "Proceed / No Further Actions" as option 9

### 2. Section Context and Review

When invoked after outputting a section:

1. **Provide Context Summary**: Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented

2. **Explain Visual Elements**: If the section contains diagrams, explain them briefly before offering elicitation options

3. **Clarify Scope Options**: If the section contains multiple distinct items, inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

### 3. Present Elicitation Options

**Review Request Process:**

- Ask the user to review the drafted section
- In the SAME message, inform them they can suggest direct changes OR select an elicitation method
- Present 9 intelligently selected methods (0-8) plus "Proceed" (9)
- Keep descriptions short - just the method name
- Await simple numeric selection

**Action List Presentation Format:**

```text
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:

0. [Method Name]
1. [Method Name]
2. [Method Name]
3. [Method Name]
4. [Method Name]
5. [Method Name]
6. [Method Name]
7. [Method Name]
8. [Method Name]
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

**Response Handling:**

- **Numbers 0-8**: Execute the selected method, then re-offer the choice
- **Number 9**: Proceed to next section or continue conversation
- **Direct Feedback**: Apply user's suggested changes and continue

### 4. Method Execution Framework

**Execution Process:**

1. **Retrieve Method**: Access the specific elicitation method from the elicitation-methods data file
2. **Apply Context**: Execute the method from your current role's perspective
3. **Provide Results**: Deliver insights, critiques, or alternatives relevant to the content
4. **Re-offer Choice**: Present the same 9 options again until user selects 9 or gives direct feedback

**Execution Guidelines:**

- **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy explanations
- **Stay Relevant**: Tie all elicitation back to the specific content being analyzed
- **Identify Personas**: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify which viewpoint is speaking
- **Maintain Flow**: Keep the process moving efficiently

# Correct Course Task

## Purpose

- Guide a structured response to a change trigger using the `{root}/checklists/change-checklist`.
- Analyze the impacts of the change on epics, project artifacts, and the MVP, guided by the checklist's structure.
- Explore potential solutions (e.g., adjust scope, rollback elements, re-scope features) as prompted by the checklist.
- Draft specific, actionable proposed updates to any affected project artifacts (e.g., epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document sections) based on the analysis.
- Produce a consolidated "Sprint Change Proposal" document that contains the impact analysis and the clearly drafted proposed edits for user review and approval.
- Ensure a clear handoff path if the nature of the changes necessitates fundamental replanning by other core agents (like PM or Architect).

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup & Mode Selection

- **Acknowledge Task & Inputs:**
  - Confirm with the user that the "Correct Course Task" (Change Navigation & Integration) is being initiated.
  - Verify the change trigger and ensure you have the user's initial explanation of the issue and its perceived impact.
  - Confirm access to all relevant project artifacts (e.g., PRD, Epics/Stories, Architecture Documents, UI/UX Specifications) and, critically, the `{root}/checklists/change-checklist`.
- **Establish Interaction Mode:**
  - Ask the user their preferred interaction mode for this task:
    - **"Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** Shall we work through the change-checklist section by section, discussing findings and collaboratively drafting proposed changes for each relevant part before moving to the next? This allows for detailed, step-by-step refinement."
    - **"YOLO Mode (Batch Processing):** Or, would you prefer I conduct a more batched analysis based on the checklist and then present a consolidated set of findings and proposed changes for a broader review? This can be quicker for initial assessment but might require more extensive review of the combined proposals."
  - Once the user chooses, confirm the selected mode and then inform the user: "We will now use the change-checklist to analyze the change and draft proposed updates. I will guide you through the checklist items based on our chosen interaction mode."

### 2. Execute Checklist Analysis (Iteratively or Batched, per Interaction Mode)

- Systematically work through Sections 1-4 of the change-checklist (typically covering Change Context, Epic/Story Impact Analysis, Artifact Conflict Resolution, and Path Evaluation/Recommendation).
- For each checklist item or logical group of items (depending on interaction mode):
  - Present the relevant prompt(s) or considerations from the checklist to the user.
  - Request necessary information and actively analyze the relevant project artifacts (PRD, epics, architecture documents, story history, etc.) to assess the impact.
  - Discuss your findings for each item with the user.
  - Record the status of each checklist item (e.g., `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Further Action Needed`) and any pertinent notes or decisions.
  - Collaboratively agree on the "Recommended Path Forward" as prompted by Section 4 of the checklist.

### 3. Draft Proposed Changes (Iteratively or Batched)

- Based on the completed checklist analysis (Sections 1-4) and the agreed "Recommended Path Forward" (excluding scenarios requiring fundamental replans that would necessitate immediate handoff to PM/Architect):
  - Identify the specific project artifacts that require updates (e.g., specific epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document components, diagrams).
  - **Draft the proposed changes directly and explicitly for each identified artifact.** Examples include:
    - Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority.
    - Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting user stories within epics.
    - Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets (e.g., providing an updated Mermaid diagram block or a clear textual description of the change to an existing diagram).
    - Updating technology lists, configuration details, or specific sections within the PRD or architecture documents.
    - Drafting new, small supporting artifacts if necessary (e.g., a brief addendum for a specific decision).
  - If in "Incremental Mode," discuss and refine these proposed edits for each artifact or small group of related artifacts with the user as they are drafted.
  - If in "YOLO Mode," compile all drafted edits for presentation in the next step.

### 4. Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits

- Synthesize the complete change-checklist analysis (covering findings from Sections 1-4) and all the agreed-upon proposed edits (from Instruction 3) into a single document titled "Sprint Change Proposal." This proposal should align with the structure suggested by Section 5 of the change-checklist.
- The proposal must clearly present:
  - **Analysis Summary:** A concise overview of the original issue, its analyzed impact (on epics, artifacts, MVP scope), and the rationale for the chosen path forward.
  - **Specific Proposed Edits:** For each affected artifact, clearly show or describe the exact changes (e.g., "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]", "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]", "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]").
- Present the complete draft of the "Sprint Change Proposal" to the user for final review and feedback. Incorporate any final adjustments requested by the user.

### 5. Finalize & Determine Next Steps

- Obtain explicit user approval for the "Sprint Change Proposal," including all the specific edits documented within it.
- Provide the finalized "Sprint Change Proposal" document to the user.
- **Based on the nature of the approved changes:**
  - **If the approved edits sufficiently address the change and can be implemented directly or organized by a PO/SM:** State that the "Correct Course Task" is complete regarding analysis and change proposal, and the user can now proceed with implementing or logging these changes (e.g., updating actual project documents, backlog items). Suggest handoff to a PO/SM agent for backlog organization if appropriate.
  - **If the analysis and proposed path (as per checklist Section 4 and potentially Section 6) indicate that the change requires a more fundamental replan (e.g., significant scope change, major architectural rework):** Clearly state this conclusion. Advise the user that the next step involves engaging the primary PM or Architect agents, using the "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for that deeper replanning effort.

## Output Deliverables

- **Primary:** A "Sprint Change Proposal" document (in markdown format). This document will contain:
  - A summary of the change-checklist analysis (issue, impact, rationale for the chosen path).
  - Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected project artifacts.
- **Implicit:** An annotated change-checklist (or the record of its completion) reflecting the discussions, findings, and decisions made during the process.

# Create Brownfield Story Task

## Purpose

Create detailed, implementation-ready stories for brownfield projects where traditional sharded PRD/architecture documents may not exist. This task bridges the gap between various documentation formats (document-project output, brownfield PRDs, epics, or user documentation) and executable stories for the Dev agent.

## When to Use This Task

**Use this task when:**

- Working on brownfield projects with non-standard documentation
- Stories need to be created from document-project output
- Working from brownfield epics without full PRD/architecture
- Existing project documentation doesn't follow BMad v4+ structure
- Need to gather additional context from user during story creation

**Use create-next-story when:**

- Working with properly sharded PRD and v4 architecture documents
- Following standard greenfield or well-documented brownfield workflow
- All technical context is available in structured format

## Task Execution Instructions

### 0. Documentation Context

Check for available documentation in this order:

1. **Sharded PRD/Architecture** (docs/prd/, docs/architecture/)
   - If found, recommend using create-next-story task instead

2. **Brownfield Architecture Document** (docs/brownfield-architecture.md or similar)
   - Created by document-project task
   - Contains actual system state, technical debt, workarounds

3. **Brownfield PRD** (docs/prd.md)
   - May contain embedded technical details

4. **Epic Files** (docs/epics/ or similar)
   - Created by brownfield-create-epic task

5. **User-Provided Documentation**
   - Ask user to specify location and format

### 1. Story Identification and Context Gathering

#### 1.1 Identify Story Source

Based on available documentation:

- **From Brownfield PRD**: Extract stories from epic sections
- **From Epic Files**: Read epic definition and story list
- **From User Direction**: Ask user which specific enhancement to implement
- **No Clear Source**: Work with user to define the story scope

#### 1.2 Gather Essential Context

CRITICAL: For brownfield stories, you MUST gather enough context for safe implementation. Be prepared to ask the user for missing information.

**Required Information Checklist:**

- [ ] What existing functionality might be affected?
- [ ] What are the integration points with current code?
- [ ] What patterns should be followed (with examples)?
- [ ] What technical constraints exist?
- [ ] Are there any "gotchas" or workarounds to know about?

If any required information is missing, list the missing information and ask the user to provide it.

### 2. Extract Technical Context from Available Sources

#### 2.1 From Document-Project Output

If using brownfield-architecture.md from document-project:

- **Technical Debt Section**: Note any workarounds affecting this story
- **Key Files Section**: Identify files that will need modification
- **Integration Points**: Find existing integration patterns
- **Known Issues**: Check if story touches problematic areas
- **Actual Tech Stack**: Verify versions and constraints

#### 2.2 From Brownfield PRD

If using brownfield PRD:

- **Technical Constraints Section**: Extract all relevant constraints
- **Integration Requirements**: Note compatibility requirements
- **Code Organization**: Follow specified patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Understand potential impacts

#### 2.3 From User Documentation

Ask the user to help identify:

- Relevant technical specifications
- Existing code examples to follow
- Integration requirements
- Testing approaches used in the project

### 3. Story Creation with Progressive Detail Gathering

#### 3.1 Create Initial Story Structure

Start with the story template, filling in what's known:

```markdown
# Story {{Enhancement Title}}

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a {{user_type}},
I want {{enhancement_capability}},
so that {{value_delivered}}.

## Context Source

- Source Document: {{document name/type}}
- Enhancement Type: {{single feature/bug fix/integration/etc}}
- Existing System Impact: {{brief assessment}}
```

#### 3.2 Develop Acceptance Criteria

Critical: For brownfield, ALWAYS include criteria about maintaining existing functionality

Standard structure:

1. New functionality works as specified
2. Existing {{affected feature}} continues to work unchanged  
3. Integration with {{existing system}} maintains current behavior
4. No regression in {{related area}}
5. Performance remains within acceptable bounds

#### 3.3 Gather Technical Guidance

Critical: This is where you'll need to be interactive with the user if information is missing

Create Dev Technical Guidance section with available information:

```markdown
## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context
[Extract from available documentation]

### Integration Approach
[Based on patterns found or ask user]

### Technical Constraints
[From documentation or user input]

### Missing Information

Critical: List anything you couldn't find that dev will need and ask for the missing information

### 4. Task Generation with Safety Checks

#### 4.1 Generate Implementation Tasks

Based on gathered context, create tasks that:

- Include exploration tasks if system understanding is incomplete
- Add verification tasks for existing functionality
- Include rollback considerations
- Reference specific files/patterns when known

Example task structure for brownfield:

```markdown
## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Analyze existing {{component/feature}} implementation
  - [ ] Review {{specific files}} for current patterns
  - [ ] Document integration points
  - [ ] Identify potential impacts

- [ ] Task 2: Implement {{new functionality}}
  - [ ] Follow pattern from {{example file}}
  - [ ] Integrate with {{existing component}}
  - [ ] Maintain compatibility with {{constraint}}

- [ ] Task 3: Verify existing functionality
  - [ ] Test {{existing feature 1}} still works
  - [ ] Verify {{integration point}} behavior unchanged
  - [ ] Check performance impact

- [ ] Task 4: Add tests
  - [ ] Unit tests following {{project test pattern}}
  - [ ] Integration test for {{integration point}}
  - [ ] Update existing tests if needed
```

### 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

CRITICAL: for brownfield - always include risk assessment

Add section for brownfield-specific risks:

```markdown
## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Primary Risk**: {{main risk to existing system}}
- **Mitigation**: {{how to address}}
- **Verification**: {{how to confirm safety}}

### Rollback Plan
- {{Simple steps to undo changes if needed}}

### Safety Checks
- [ ] Existing {{feature}} tested before changes
- [ ] Changes can be feature-flagged or isolated
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
```

### 6. Final Story Validation

Before finalizing:

1. **Completeness Check**:
   - [ ] Story has clear scope and acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Technical context is sufficient for implementation
   - [ ] Integration approach is defined
   - [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation

2. **Safety Check**:
   - [ ] Existing functionality protection included
   - [ ] Rollback plan is feasible
   - [ ] Testing covers both new and existing features

3. **Information Gaps**:
   - [ ] All critical missing information gathered from user
   - [ ] Remaining unknowns documented for dev agent
   - [ ] Exploration tasks added where needed

### 7. Story Output Format

Save the story with appropriate naming:

- If from epic: `docs/stories/epic-{n}-story-{m}.md`
- If standalone: `docs/stories/brownfield-{feature-name}.md`
- If sequential: Follow existing story numbering

Include header noting documentation context:

```markdown
# Story: {{Title}}

<!-- Source: {{documentation type used}} -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to {{existing system}} -->

## Status: Draft
[Rest of story content...]
```

### 8. Handoff Communication

Provide clear handoff to the user:

```text
Brownfield story created: {{story title}}

Source Documentation: {{what was used}}
Story Location: {{file path}}

Key Integration Points Identified:
- {{integration point 1}}
- {{integration point 2}}

Risks Noted:
- {{primary risk}}

{{If missing info}}: 
Note: Some technical details were unclear. The story includes exploration tasks to gather needed information during implementation.

Next Steps:
1. Review story for accuracy
2. Verify integration approach aligns with your system
3. Approve story or request adjustments
4. Dev agent can then implement with safety checks
```

## Success Criteria

The brownfield story creation is successful when:

1. Story can be implemented without requiring dev to search multiple documents
2. Integration approach is clear and safe for existing system
3. All available technical context has been extracted and organized
4. Missing information has been identified and addressed
5. Risks are documented with mitigation strategies
6. Story includes verification of existing functionality
7. Rollback approach is defined

## Important Notes

- This task is specifically for brownfield projects with non-standard documentation
- Always prioritize existing system stability over new features
- When in doubt, add exploration and verification tasks
- It's better to ask the user for clarification than make assumptions
- Each story should be self-contained for the dev agent
- Include references to existing code patterns when available

# Create Next Story Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow

- Load `{root}/core-config.yaml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy it from GITHUB bmad-core/core-config.yaml and configure it for your project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure core-config.yaml before proceeding."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

#### 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories

- Based on `prdSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic PRD sections)
- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
- **If highest story exists:**
  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"

### 2. Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context

- Extract story requirements from the identified epic file
- If previous story exists, review Dev Agent Record sections for:
  - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
  - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
  - Challenges encountered and lessons learned
- Extract relevant insights that inform the current story's preparation

### 3. Gather Architecture Context

#### 3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy

- **If `architectureVersion: >= v4` and `architectureSharded: true`**: Read `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md` then follow structured reading order below
- **Else**: Use monolithic `architectureFile` for similar sections

#### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type

**For ALL Stories:** tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md

**For Backend/API Stories, additionally:** data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md, rest-api-spec.md, external-apis.md

**For Frontend/UI Stories, additionally:** frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md, data-models.md

**For Full-Stack Stories:** Read both Backend and Frontend sections above

#### 3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details

Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story. Do NOT invent new libraries, patterns, or standards not in the source documents.

Extract:

- Specific data models, schemas, or structures the story will use
- API endpoints the story must implement or consume
- Component specifications for UI elements in the story
- File paths and naming conventions for new code
- Testing requirements specific to the story's features
- Security or performance considerations affecting the story

ALWAYS cite source documents: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

### 4. Verify Project Structure Alignment

- Cross-reference story requirements with Project Structure Guide from `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`
- Ensure file paths, component locations, or module names align with defined structures
- Document any structural conflicts in "Project Structure Notes" section within the story draft

### 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context

- Create new story file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` using Story Template
- Fill in basic story information: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, Acceptance Criteria from Epic
- **`Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**
  - CRITICAL: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from architecture documents. NEVER invent or assume technical details.
  - Include ALL relevant technical details from Steps 2-3, organized by category:
    - **Previous Story Insights**: Key learnings from previous story
    - **Data Models**: Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships [with source references]
    - **API Specifications**: Endpoint details, request/response formats, auth requirements [with source references]
    - **Component Specifications**: UI component details, props, state management [with source references]
    - **File Locations**: Exact paths where new code should be created based on project structure
    - **Testing Requirements**: Specific test cases or strategies from testing-strategy.md
    - **Technical Constraints**: Version requirements, performance considerations, security rules
  - Every technical detail MUST include its source reference: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
  - If information for a category is not found in the architecture docs, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs"
- **`Tasks / Subtasks` section:**
  - Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information
  - Each task must reference relevant architecture documentation
  - Include unit testing as explicit subtasks based on the Testing Strategy
  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`)
- Add notes on project structure alignment or discrepancies found in Step 4

### 6. Story Draft Completion and Review

- Review all sections for completeness and accuracy
- Verify all source references are included for technical details
- Ensure tasks align with both epic requirements and architecture constraints
- Update status to "Draft" and save the story file
- Execute `{root}/tasks/execute-checklist` `{root}/checklists/story-draft-checklist`
- Provide summary to user including:
  - Story created: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
  - Status: Draft
  - Key technical components included from architecture docs
  - Any deviations or conflicts noted between epic and architecture
  - Checklist Results
  - Next steps: For Complex stories, suggest the user carefully review the story draft and also optionally have the PO run the task `{root}/tasks/validate-next-story`

# Document an Existing Project

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. This task creates structured reference materials that enable AI agents to understand project context, conventions, and patterns for effective contribution to any codebase.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Initial Project Analysis

**CRITICAL:** First, check if a PRD or requirements document exists in context. If yes, use it to focus your documentation efforts on relevant areas only.

**IF PRD EXISTS**:

- Review the PRD to understand what enhancement/feature is planned
- Identify which modules, services, or areas will be affected
- Focus documentation ONLY on these relevant areas
- Skip unrelated parts of the codebase to keep docs lean

**IF NO PRD EXISTS**:
Ask the user:

"I notice you haven't provided a PRD or requirements document. To create more focused and useful documentation, I recommend one of these options:

1. **Create a PRD first** - Would you like me to help create a brownfield PRD before documenting? This helps focus documentation on relevant areas.

2. **Provide existing requirements** - Do you have a requirements document, epic, or feature description you can share?

3. **Describe the focus** - Can you briefly describe what enhancement or feature you're planning? For example:
   - 'Adding payment processing to the user service'
   - 'Refactoring the authentication module'
   - 'Integrating with a new third-party API'

4. **Document everything** - Or should I proceed with comprehensive documentation of the entire codebase? (Note: This may create excessive documentation for large projects)

Please let me know your preference, or I can proceed with full documentation if you prefer."

Based on their response:

- If they choose option 1-3: Use that context to focus documentation
- If they choose option 4 or decline: Proceed with comprehensive analysis below

Begin by conducting analysis of the existing project. Use available tools to:

1. **Project Structure Discovery**: Examine the root directory structure, identify main folders, and understand the overall organization
2. **Technology Stack Identification**: Look for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc. to identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies
3. **Build System Analysis**: Find build scripts, CI/CD configurations, and development commands
4. **Existing Documentation Review**: Check for README files, docs folders, and any existing documentation
5. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Sample key files to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches

Ask the user these elicitation questions to better understand their needs:

- What is the primary purpose of this project?
- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are particularly complex or important for agents to understand?
- What types of tasks do you expect AI agents to perform on this project? (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, testing)
- Are there any existing documentation standards or formats you prefer?
- What level of technical detail should the documentation target? (junior developers, senior developers, mixed team)
- Is there a specific feature or enhancement you're planning? (This helps focus documentation)

### 2. Deep Codebase Analysis

CRITICAL: Before generating documentation, conduct extensive analysis of the existing codebase:

1. **Explore Key Areas**:
   - Entry points (main files, index files, app initializers)
   - Configuration files and environment setup
   - Package dependencies and versions
   - Build and deployment configurations
   - Test suites and coverage

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
   - "I see you're using [technology X]. Are there any custom patterns or conventions I should document?"
   - "What are the most critical/complex parts of this system that developers struggle with?"
   - "Are there any undocumented 'tribal knowledge' areas I should capture?"
   - "What technical debt or known issues should I document?"
   - "Which parts of the codebase change most frequently?"

3. **Map the Reality**:
   - Identify ACTUAL patterns used (not theoretical best practices)
   - Find where key business logic lives
   - Locate integration points and external dependencies
   - Document workarounds and technical debt
   - Note areas that differ from standard patterns

**IF PRD PROVIDED**: Also analyze what would need to change for the enhancement

### 3. Core Documentation Generation

[[LLM: Generate a comprehensive BROWNFIELD architecture document that reflects the ACTUAL state of the codebase.

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT an aspirational architecture document. Document what EXISTS, including:

- Technical debt and workarounds
- Inconsistent patterns between different parts
- Legacy code that can't be changed
- Integration constraints
- Performance bottlenecks

**Document Structure**:

# [Project Name] Brownfield Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document captures the CURRENT STATE of the [Project Name] codebase, including technical debt, workarounds, and real-world patterns. It serves as a reference for AI agents working on enhancements.

### Document Scope

[If PRD provided: "Focused on areas relevant to: {enhancement description}"]
[If no PRD: "Comprehensive documentation of entire system"]

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Date] | 1.0 | Initial brownfield analysis | [Analyst] |

## Quick Reference - Key Files and Entry Points

### Critical Files for Understanding the System

- **Main Entry**: `src/index.js` (or actual entry point)
- **Configuration**: `config/app.config.js`, `.env.example`
- **Core Business Logic**: `src/services/`, `src/domain/`
- **API Definitions**: `src/routes/` or link to OpenAPI spec
- **Database Models**: `src/models/` or link to schema files
- **Key Algorithms**: [List specific files with complex logic]

### If PRD Provided - Enhancement Impact Areas

[Highlight which files/modules will be affected by the planned enhancement]

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

### Actual Tech Stack (from package.json/requirements.txt)

| Category | Technology | Version | Notes |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Runtime | Node.js | 16.x | [Any constraints] |
| Framework | Express | 4.18.2 | [Custom middleware?] |
| Database | PostgreSQL | 13 | [Connection pooling setup] |

etc...

### Repository Structure Reality Check

- Type: [Monorepo/Polyrepo/Hybrid]
- Package Manager: [npm/yarn/pnpm]
- Notable: [Any unusual structure decisions]

## Source Tree and Module Organization

### Project Structure (Actual)

```text
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/     # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── services/        # Business logic (NOTE: inconsistent patterns between user and payment services)
│   ├── models/          # Database models (Sequelize)
│   ├── utils/           # Mixed bag - needs refactoring
│   └── legacy/          # DO NOT MODIFY - old payment system still in use
├── tests/               # Jest tests (60% coverage)
├── scripts/             # Build and deployment scripts
└── config/              # Environment configs
```

### Key Modules and Their Purpose

- **User Management**: `src/services/userService.js` - Handles all user operations
- **Authentication**: `src/middleware/auth.js` - JWT-based, custom implementation
- **Payment Processing**: `src/legacy/payment.js` - CRITICAL: Do not refactor, tightly coupled
- **[List other key modules with their actual files]**

## Data Models and APIs

### Data Models

Instead of duplicating, reference actual model files:
- **User Model**: See `src/models/User.js`
- **Order Model**: See `src/models/Order.js`
- **Related Types**: TypeScript definitions in `src/types/`

### API Specifications

- **OpenAPI Spec**: `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (if exists)
- **Postman Collection**: `docs/api/postman-collection.json`
- **Manual Endpoints**: [List any undocumented endpoints discovered]

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Critical Technical Debt

1. **Payment Service**: Legacy code in `src/legacy/payment.js` - tightly coupled, no tests
2. **User Service**: Different pattern than other services, uses callbacks instead of promises
3. **Database Migrations**: Manually tracked, no proper migration tool
4. **[Other significant debt]**

### Workarounds and Gotchas

- **Environment Variables**: Must set `NODE_ENV=production` even for staging (historical reason)
- **Database Connections**: Connection pool hardcoded to 10, changing breaks payment service
- **[Other workarounds developers need to know]**

## Integration Points and External Dependencies

### External Services

| Service | Purpose | Integration Type | Key Files |
|---------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Stripe | Payments | REST API | `src/integrations/stripe/` |
| SendGrid | Emails | SDK | `src/services/emailService.js` |

etc...

### Internal Integration Points

- **Frontend Communication**: REST API on port 3000, expects specific headers
- **Background Jobs**: Redis queue, see `src/workers/`
- **[Other integrations]**

## Development and Deployment

### Local Development Setup

1. Actual steps that work (not ideal steps)
2. Known issues with setup
3. Required environment variables (see `.env.example`)

### Build and Deployment Process

- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (webpack config in `webpack.config.js`)
- **Deployment**: Manual deployment via `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Environments**: Dev, Staging, Prod (see `config/environments/`)

## Testing Reality

### Current Test Coverage

- Unit Tests: 60% coverage (Jest)
- Integration Tests: Minimal, in `tests/integration/`
- E2E Tests: None
- Manual Testing: Primary QA method

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test           # Runs unit tests
npm run test:integration  # Runs integration tests (requires local DB)
```

## If Enhancement PRD Provided - Impact Analysis

### Files That Will Need Modification

Based on the enhancement requirements, these files will be affected:
- `src/services/userService.js` - Add new user fields
- `src/models/User.js` - Update schema
- `src/routes/userRoutes.js` - New endpoints
- [etc...]

### New Files/Modules Needed

- `src/services/newFeatureService.js` - New business logic
- `src/models/NewFeature.js` - New data model
- [etc...]

### Integration Considerations

- Will need to integrate with existing auth middleware
- Must follow existing response format in `src/utils/responseFormatter.js`
- [Other integration points]

## Appendix - Useful Commands and Scripts

### Frequently Used Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Production build
npm run migrate     # Run database migrations
npm run seed        # Seed test data
```

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: Check `logs/app.log` for application logs
- **Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG=app:*` for verbose logging
- **Common Issues**: See `docs/troubleshooting.md`]]

### 4. Document Delivery

1. **In Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)**:
   - Present the entire document in one response (or multiple if too long)
   - Tell user to copy and save as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
   - Mention it can be sharded later in IDE if needed

2. **In IDE Environment**:
   - Create the document as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
   - Inform user this single document contains all architectural information
   - Can be sharded later using PO agent if desired

The document should be comprehensive enough that future agents can understand:

- The actual state of the system (not idealized)
- Where to find key files and logic
- What technical debt exists
- What constraints must be respected
- If PRD provided: What needs to change for the enhancement]]

### 5. Quality Assurance

CRITICAL: Before finalizing the document:

1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all technical details match the actual codebase
2. **Completeness Review**: Ensure all major system components are documented
3. **Focus Validation**: If user provided scope, verify r
